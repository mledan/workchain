#### 4. **Regulatory Compliance**
**Risk**: Payment regulations, gig economy laws

**Mitigation**:
- Legal counsel from day one
- Compliance-first approach
- Work with payment processors who handle compliance

#### 5. **Blockchain Complexity**
**Risk**: Users intimidated by blockchain

**Mitigation**:
- Faux-blockchain MVP (no crypto required)
